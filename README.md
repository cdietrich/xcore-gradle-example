Xcore Gradle Example
---

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghillairet/xcore-gradle-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghillairet/xcore-gradle-example)

This project shows how to use Gradle with the xtext-gradle-plugin to generate Java code from an Xcore model.

To run it, you need Gradle (tested on 3.1) and use the command:

```
./gradlew clean build --gradle-user-home=.g/
```
